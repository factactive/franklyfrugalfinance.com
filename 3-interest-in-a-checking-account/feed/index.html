		<description><![CDATA[Well, being a credit union, they don&#039;t need to give profits to shareholders, as a member you are the owner.  Also they cap how much can earn that interest rate, so a married couple each with an account cannot exceed $30,000 in deposits earning that kind of interest.

And yea, I do wonder why they do things like offer auto loans at a lower rate than what they give for interest?  But they are doing good and have  started to expand again (everything around here took a pause after the recession).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember the days when I earned one penny on my $300 in my savings account each month.  Those days are long gone.  Do you wonder how the bank is still in business at those rates? 

Cheers,
Henry]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know what you are saying and 2.25% is very good.  Especially since it is a local option so if you have an issue you can resolve it in person which is nice.

Who knows when a correction will come, but yea it makes it less painful to carry a balance over what you would normally for emergencies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My bank (a small, local bank) actually offers 2.25% interest on balances up to $10k, and we definitely take advantage of it.  It&#039;s better than what we get in our MM account, and I haven&#039;t even seen anything that comes close to it.  It doesn&#039;t make me feel as bad parking my money in cash, waiting for a correction when I can plow it into the market, you know?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[3% is very nice and I think most people in the personal finance realm can take advantage of this because we have emergency funds.  I also like that I get upto $20/mo reimbursed from ATM fees (this amount depends on your &quot;membership level&quot;, right now I think I am at the highest level, but the mid level gives $10 so that isn&#039;t bad either).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I *think* I tried both at work and at home, but if I remember I will try when I am home in a bit.  The good thing about a slow cooker meal is I don&#039;t need to cook when I get home so I have a bit more extra time :).  That should give me some time to work on my over-due stock purchase post... at least get it far enough that I can complete it for Friday.]]></description>
