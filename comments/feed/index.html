		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeff,

Thanks for stopping by and welcome to the blogging world!  It appears you started recently in November, I was on a bit of a hiatus late October and early November, but I am back in action and trying to keep myself accountable.

Paying off debt is a bit slower, in theory, than investing for building debt.  But you have guaranteed returns and can really open up cash flow to poor into your investments as well as immediately decrease your current cash needs.  I count that as two wins versus one loss, so I like the idea of paying off debt early.

Thanks for coming by!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Cecilia!
Yea, I need to pick which loan is next on the hit list and go from there.  I have to remember when visiting your blog to copy my entire post before clicking submit... because the first time it logs me into the google account and clears out the text often leaving me frustrated.  I remembered this time at least!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for stopping by Thomas!  I still hate that your page doesn&#039;t load, I keep trying to go there and have to do that google cache page, which is quite slow as well :(.

I believe that I will become a Millionaire, but having a Million really isn&#039;t exactly the goal.  Having no debt and being financially independent are the goals.  Being a millionaire will more than likely be a side effect of those goals due to inflation by the time I get to that point!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks DD!  I do like tracking the categories, I don&#039;t actually subtotal each area, but it is pretty easy to see how much is left outstanding in cars or home after taking away the corresponding debt.  I might be getting my own version of a Franken Caddy that J-Money has ( https://franklyfrugalfinance.com/ ).  It is a buick that someone is selling cheap that was hit on the side, but runs a hell of alot better than my neon.  Runs over looks!]]></description>
