		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in northern Indiana, so not so far away from you, and the fall weather is definitely beautiful...and yet also a challenge to the grocery budget, since all of a sudden I want to eat constantly (I always get really hungry in cold weather.) Chili is a good idea. Maybe next weekend, if it&#039;s going to stay this cold!]]></description>
