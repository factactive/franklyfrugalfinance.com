		<description><![CDATA[Gosh, is there any time left to do it this year with how far north you live?  The temperature is supposed to stay above 50 degrees for drying according to my stain at least!

On a side note, I am excited to see how my perspective of things may change during this challenge.  The only real currency we have is time, and in reality we don&#039;t even know how much of that we have!  But with a theoretical end date, it can make some interesting thoughts for what is worth doing or not doing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha, yes they do match in a way.  Helps that they are the same make and kind of the same model.  One is just a men&#039;s bike while the other is a woman&#039;s (bet you guessed the pink one was the men&#039;s bike, huh?)

Weekend was good, busy with that deck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

Thanks for the mention! Much appreciated. 

The deck looks awesome, bud. Glad you were able to get that in while the weather was really nice. And the bikes look good too. I hope you and the missus are able to get some rides in before it turns cold. 

I spent the last few days moving back to Florida, and then hitting the town with my partner while we scouted out some places to take some shots of the city. 

I hope you have a great week over there!

Best regards.]]></description>
