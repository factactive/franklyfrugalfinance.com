		<description><![CDATA[No problem, I enjoyed your article.  Yea, I think it is important to make the distinction that if you enjoy it, there is no reason to outsource just because you can make more money doing X, but for those tasks that your don&#039;t enjoy it is worth finding a way to pay for it.

MMM is definitely all about DIY, that&#039;s for sure!  I guess if you are retired you probably have time to do everything, but we are not, so it is important in how we allocate our time between making money and doing the things we enjoy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heyo!

I do conduct quite a few DIY projects.  I enjoy them a lot for the most part.  For instance, I never let anyone else touch my car.  Save me $$ and it&#039;s fun.  But I would have little time for adventure if I was busy doing eeeeevvveerrrrryyyttthhhiiiinnnggg myself.

I used to be very into MMM but my life was starting to stall out on the adventure side of things...

Thanks for the mention!!!  I&#039;ve never been here before but I like it!]]></description>
