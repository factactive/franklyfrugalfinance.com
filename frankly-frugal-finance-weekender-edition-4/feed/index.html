		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kipp,

Sorry for the delay on this but thank you for including me in your round up. Life has gotten pretty busy for me lately and I&#039;m just starting to get back into a more normal routine, so I&#039;m playing a little catch-up with a lot of the stuff that I let slide in the meantime! Anyways, I really appreciate the support!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ryan,
I try to limit the roundups to 5 links that way it isn&#039;t too big of a list.  I did really like your post on How you Should Think About Stock Market Drops.
Maybe in the future I will have to grow the list a little bit more.]]></description>

Enjoy the book! It&#039;s massive, but an easy read. :)

I&#039;ll be posting pics of GR later this week, hopefully. 

Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

You are welcome, I enjoyed the article.  Yes it is warm but I did take a walk to the library earlier to pickup The Snowball, so now I have that to read!  I hope you enjoy your time over at your sisters!
