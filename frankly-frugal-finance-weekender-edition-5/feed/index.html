		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention and hope you had a great weekend.  I&#039;m also cool with a tie!  I&#039;m in good company and liked FI Pilgrim&#039;s post as well.  While I&#039;d like to get rid of some stuff, our 600 sq foot apartment has limited our ability to accumulate TOO much stuff, which is a good thing I guess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Ryan!  Actually I was a bit sick over the weekend and slept alot and started to pressure wash my deck to paint it.  That is a bit more tedious than I was expecting... the deck has too many little rail guards in my opinion.  Still need to finish that...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

With student loans I think all of the default repayment plans are over 10 years.  So for us we will knock those out before the end of 2023... Which seems so far away! But before we are 40 we will be part of the 20% if everything goes to plan.

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

Appreciate the inclusion!

Can&#039;t say I&#039;m part of the 20%, but I keep debt around as a mathematical decision, not because I can&#039;t afford to pay it. Though, it&#039;ll be nice to one day have it behind me. 

Hope you&#039;re having  a great weekend.

Best wishes.]]></description>
