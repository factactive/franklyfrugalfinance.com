		<description><![CDATA[Hey Anha,

Well if you are not maxing out pretax investing, it could be a good way to see how much you can add to your contributions.  Not sure on your long term plans if pretax savings is how you want to go or not.  I do a little bit of everything, pretax, ROTH, and brokerage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey NMW,

I got a secret... I have my portfolio on google spreadsheets and a page created, I just discovered that adding another page on my menu adds another line.  That and I want to tweak my spreadsheet maybe a little more as well but you can take a sneak peak: http://www.franklyfrugalfinance.com/portfolio/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Erin,

No I browsed Craigslist maybe once or twice to see what was on there, they were purchased new.  To be honest spending wise it wasn&#039;t a bad month, we went out to the movies a couple times, had dinner out a couple times, got bikes, and had a decent sized bi-annual payment.  Nothing really out of the ordinary for us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks great to me! You&#039;re doing a nice job of keeping your spending low. Did you buy the two bikes used? That&#039;s not a bad price. And that is really annoying about the tolls - I&#039;ve only been through ones that are staffed with people. I guess other parts of the country do it differently!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Cecilia, I am very happy with the savings rate!  Yea, I was waiting for a good sale before buying a bunch of socks.  Being I normally shop at the same store I have a good feel for what deals normally are, so I can try to time stuff to get the best savings.]]></description>
