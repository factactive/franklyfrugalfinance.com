		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jay.  I hope you are able to find ways to save in your new town!  Even if your savings rate % is down, if your dollar amount is up and you plan on moving back after financial independence it may still be helpful move, so the percent isn&#039;t necessarily everything if you are planning on moving!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats! That&#039;s a hefty savings rate. Mine has taken a dive due to moving to a new city and adjusting to the absurd cost of living. I&#039;ll get back there soon though... I hope.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks No More Waffles!  Yea 65% would have been without the deductible, I just need to keep this month tight as well to get through the second payment (once they are actually done that is).  It looks like you had a phenomenal savings rate yourself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

Great job overall! Too bad about the hailstorm, but these things happen. Don&#039;t let them get you down!

Almost 65% is an excellent savings rate and something to be proud about.

Keep it up!

		<description><![CDATA[No Problem, I will be getting some more dividend stocks once the ROTH transfer is complete, then after that probably around October or November once we get a single student loan out of here.  I can&#039;t wait to get rid of it :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your income and expenses for the month. I look forward to following that dividend income progress. I&#039;m sure over the months and year over year you&#039;ll be amazed at how the income will grow. Till next time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The plus side is that we need to know our weaknesses and leaks to improve, and at least we aren&#039;t oblivious.  I am not for the cold turkey approach, I am more for cutting back gradually of finding innovative ways to reduce the expense.  An example, for alcohol I now ferment juice so that will reduce the costs in this category.  Also, pop/soda, we now are only consuming 1 2-liter a week between my wife and I.  A big improvement.  But the high cost of this area seems to stem from coffee and grabbing drinks while driving.  Need to work on that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi MidwestFabs,

Thanks for the compliment!  Income is based on my Net, but I add back in Retirement contributions (including any employer matching).  I also take out charitable donations, that is the one area I choose to keep private.

The reason I use net income is because the Simple Math Behind Early retirement (post from Mr Money Mustache) uses your net income plus retirement contributions as a guide towards financial independence time frame.

Thanks for stopping by!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think biggest areas for improvement are eating out a little less and buying less snack like stuff (in this category I include only “optional” food purchases, like juice, soda, chips, etc.)

This one ends up being a tough one for me, it&#039;s my &quot;leak&quot; like a great poker player who plays craps and loses it slowly.]]></description>
