		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Cecilia!  I agree, it is a good way to compare options and process information, because you have to write down the reason rationally.  So it helps me and it may help someone else, kind of a win-win!

I just went over to your blog, it looks like you are killing that debt!  Good job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kipp,

I&#039;m commenting here because I just backread through all your posts :) Followed a link off the Rockstar net worth list. Congrats on getting on top of things while you&#039;re still in your 20s -- it took me much longer than that! Blogging is a really nice way to think through what you&#039;re doing financially, so I hope you keep enjoying it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Laurie!  I think even just the process of trying to go through and rationalize decisions helps, because if it doesn&#039;t make sense to you when you put it down why would it to someone else?  But the support in this community is great too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the encouragement and stopping by!  It is a process, but figuring out how and where to improve is part of the fun!

Weight has been going quite well actually, better than expected.  Started the year around 215 and as I mentioned on my goals I am just above 185 currently.  I think the big part is not over eating, but increasing activity is helping as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You sound like me!  I, unfortunately, have weight to lose too, and finances that need to get in shape as well.  The fact that you&#039;ve realized you need to change is half of the problem.  Now, you just have to learn and grow in order to actually make the changes.  Keep up the good work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

Great to see you caught the financial independence microbe at a young age and welcome to the blogosphere from one brand new blogger to another!

I hope you&#039;ll find emotional stability and enjoy the FI journey. Keep it up!

Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for stopping by Zee.  It is AMAZING how much you can cut and not even notice.  There are some things, such as soda, that I miss cutting back on, but it is healthier for me which actually gives me extra motivation.  Eating out on lunches... I still have a subway gift card I got in February on my birthday, because, after a while your desire for these things disappears.  I have enough on that card to get 1 or 2 more subs (haven&#039;t used it in awhile so I really don&#039;t know), and I will at some point I am sure... maybe before my next birthday!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kipp,

I can tell you the percentage of money you need to save - as much as you can.

For me it was reading over on Financial Samurai about &quot;Save until it hurts, then cut back a little&quot;. I was saving more than most articles I read so I thought I was doing good. But my current savings rate at the time still allowed me to buy things without really considering each purchase because I still had money to just get things that I wanted. Once I cranked up the saving to where I really had to consider each purchase otherwise it would slash my savings goal for the month, I made better purchases. I can still buy things that I really want, but I think about it more and weed out the crap. I realized I also didn&#039;t miss any of the smaller purchases that I would waste money on.

It sounds like you&#039;re on the right path, I look forward to reading more in the future!
