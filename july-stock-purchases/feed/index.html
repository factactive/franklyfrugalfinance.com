		<description><![CDATA[Yea, I actually owned them on a gut purchase previously and sold and re-bought them now for the long haul.  Although trading can be fun, it isn&#039;t the best long-term solution for building wealth imo.  Which is why I am focusing my ROTH accounts on stocks that I will just keep and eventually pull the interest out of when I retire.  I see you just put out a post mentioning 3 of the stocks I have mentioned as purchases as good values.  I think most dividend investors seem to shy away from RGR, we&#039;ll see how it does for me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea, ~ 1,400 put into each new position.  From here it will probably be like every other month when I am adding to the ROTH to keep transactions fees low.
But I guess that depends on if I rollover my wife&#039;s ROTH sooner than later, need to figure out all of the fees involved to make that decision.  If it gets rolled over sooner than later there will be another shopping spree lol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

No problem, I enjoyed your article.  I need to link up with more of the dividend guys because I know I saw someone else purchasing (or looking at) Deere recently, but couldn&#039;t remember who to give them a shout.

As long as you don&#039;t think my tractor is sexy, we&#039;re all good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

Thanks for the mention.

Glad to see you as a fellow shareholder in Deere!

I think DE will serve us well over the long haul. Green dividends are coming our way (in more than one way). 

Best wishes.]]></description>
