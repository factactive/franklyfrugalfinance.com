I hope you father pulls through OK.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kipp, that&#039;s got to be an incredibly rough conversation to have. I&#039;m glad the operation went so smoothly too! It&#039;s really cool that you were able to tie this emotional time to a financial and life lesson. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Grayson.  I completely agree that the crowd that claims &quot;YOLO&quot; is the crowd that actually acts against what they claim.  In truly thinking about living just once, you should focus your time and money on what is important, and that seems to be missed by the crowd, and as you said, creates a disservice to the actual meaning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you Dad is good Kipp.  I think the YOLO crowd actually does a disservice to the message.  Yes, you only live once, but that doesn&#039;t mean you need to grow crazy and buy a bunch of crap or travel all over. You need to do what makes you happy and spend time with those who keep you in that state.  You also need to understand where you are going.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Holly, it was my dad&#039;s procedure (not mine... man if I need a stent at age 27 that would be SAD).  And yes, the key is to have a purpose for your money, either spend it on what matters now or in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, I&#039;m glad to hear that your procedure went well!

I try to balance my YOLO mentality with my sincere desire to be prepared for the future.  It&#039;s true that you only live once, but it&#039;s also true that you might live a long time.  Like you said, it&#039;s all about being purposeful with your money and making each dollar/moment count.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Deb,
It is kind of odd that the real world doesn&#039;t realize it.  I mean how many people do you need to see die or nearly die before you wake up?]]></description>
