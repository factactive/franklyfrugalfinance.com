		<description><![CDATA[I think this is a very interesting topic and an excellent exercise. I would hope to see what is really important to me when believing time is short and then being able to make those things part of my life going forward. I look forward to hearing what you find doing this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely believe in eternity. Like you, I&#039;m a little sad, but not for me. I&#039;m sad for my girls to grow up without their mom. Sad for the hubs to have to do it all alone. But I&#039;ve caught myself (really getting into this) and being happy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely with family, friends, and pets if you have them.  Travel can be debatable, I don&#039;t want to spend my last days running around and not pause and actually spend time with who matter.  It would be great to combine things if possible, but would you really want something fast paced trying to see as much as you can before you die but miss out on just spending time with your loved ones?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there is more I can do in life before passing, but there is always more you can do.  How often do we stop and look to see that perhaps we are satisfied?  That said I want to spend more time volunteering.  It is difficult to do so when working full time, but starting out with small steps.]]></description>
