		<description><![CDATA[As the kids say these days, YOLO?

I think this is a valuable mental exercise, but a literal interpretation seems like it would focus you on short term gain at the cost of long term problems.

If I was going to croak tomorrow I wouldn&#039;t bother working out and I&#039;d eat donuts for breakfast, steak for lunch, and pizza for dinner :-)  And it would be awesome!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I try to live without regrets.  I know that it&#039;s not possible to have zero regrets, but if I can minimize them....  Therefore, if an opportunity comes up my wife and I talk about  if one of us will regret not doing it.  If so, we try very hard to make it happen.  The whole no regrets thing runs somewhat counter to my latest post on contentment, but hey......life&#039;s a balance.

Have a great weekend
