		<description><![CDATA[No problem Jason, if you can recall when you mentioned that I would gladly link to your post.
And I think this challenge of only living for 31 days (less now of course) is to focus on now and trying to get the most value out of your time.  Some of that may be spending money doing activities with loved ones, but it needs to be something of value.  I hope that this month will open my perspective and bring me closer to living that dream now as a result!

And yea, if I were actually dying I don&#039;t think I would be spending my time blogging - although it is probably a good idea to write something so your last thoughts are available for your loved ones.  Blogging can serve that purpose as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point. Seems a lot of times we get caught up in working or blogging or whatever, and really just don&#039;t sit and appreciate the fact that we are alive and here at this moment. As for me, I&#039;d spend the first few weeks doing everything I could fit into my schedule (dat bucket list, yo). The last few days, I&#039;d just sit on the balcony with my girlfriend and parents and just watch the world go by. The older you get, the more you realize how little really matters in the grand scheme of things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

Great post!

And thanks for the mention. :)

I definitely think being present is incredibly important in regards to being happy. It allows you to focus your mind and actually enjoy being in the now. I know it&#039;s natural to worry about tomorrow and focus on what you don&#039;t already have, but I always try to be happy for who I am, where I am, and what I already have. Therefore, if I found out I was dying I&#039;d simply do as I&#039;m doing now. I&#039;d probably relax more and write less, but, overall, I&#039;m already living my own dream. Always wanting more will surely lead you to disappointment. Just being alive is a gift, so to find out I was dying faster (I&#039;m already dying one day at a time anyway) would only reinforce that belief.

Best regards!]]></description>
