I think that is the key - balance and creating memories!  I wouldn&#039;t want to be constantly going all the time and miss out on just spending time with those who matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Family time is definitely more important than anything else.  That being said, I joined a challenge where I would write at least 500 words every day this week.  I won&#039;t post every day, but I will write every day.  The good thing about just writing is that it doesn&#039;t have to take too much time.  I find that i spend more time editing than I do writing... well maybe not more time, but you know what I mean.  I just have to write 500 words, it doesn&#039;t have to make too much sense or be well written.  That shouldn&#039;t take too much time away from my honey.]]></description>
