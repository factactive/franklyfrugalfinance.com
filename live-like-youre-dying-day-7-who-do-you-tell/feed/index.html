		<description><![CDATA[Hey Brian,

That is kind of what I was getting at... telling people will change their interaction with you, is that really what you want?  Or do you want it to be how you normally would spend time?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is definitely interesting to see how people would decide who to tell!  I am not sure I would tell everyone if it wasn&#039;t something obvious, but everyone you would want to see in the short period of time is someone who you would probably want to know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an interesting hypothetical. I think I would probably lean towards telling everyone so that people could interact with me in whatever way felt most natural/needed for them. That being said, I imagine I would ruthlessly prioritize my time to only being with my family and closest friends, so I&#039;m not even sure I&#039;d be spending much time anywhere else.]]></description>
