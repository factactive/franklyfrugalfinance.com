		<description><![CDATA[I had a thought today as a work around to still receive the benefit without working.  More on that later, maybe Monday :).

But that said... as I discussed before, we trade our time for MUCH less than $400 an hour.  It comes down to a sense of sacrifice I suppose.  The only thing that truly matters in the short period of time is who you are spending the time with, not how much money is being spent to you.  But with others involved, the money can be of value to them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kipp,

I still can&#039;t believe you value your time at $400/hr if you know you&#039;re going to die in 30 days. You could pay me $1,000/hour and I wouldn&#039;t be going into a jobby job and clocking in. No way, no how :)

And I also know my significant other would rather see me more those last 30 days than collect the cash. 

It&#039;s like &quot;Hey honey! I&#039;m dying in a month. But I gotta go get that cash for us. Maybe I&#039;ll take off my last day so we can spend the day together.&quot; Avoiding a silly scenario like that is exactly why we do what we do. :)

Best regards!]]></description>
