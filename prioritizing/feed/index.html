		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, I&#039;ve been struggling with this big time here as we work to try and get all of the fruits and veggies canned and preserved.  I wish I had advice for you, but I don&#039;t.  I would say though that you shouldn&#039;t feel bad for cutting out things that may be at the bottom of your list.  That&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned as I&#039;ve gotten older.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have to agree that scheduling helps.  It will force you to be productive when you are on a task, like my time now on the computer.  If I only allotted so much time to write a post, reply to comments, and check out other blogs, I probably wouldn&#039;t have went over to google anaylatics or adsense and checked on those.  I probably shouldn&#039;t anyways, word press gives a little notification when I get a spike in traffic anyways so maybe I should just look at it when something major is going on like a link from Dividend Mantra or Rock Star Finance... although it is good to look at to give shout outs for the support from other bloggers, but I can leave that for weekly wrap-ups.  Don&#039;t need to do that every time.

Anyways, on the scheduling part, just scheduling meals has made a HUGE difference for us.  Less &quot;what do you want to have tonight?&quot; and less eating out, and less weight!  Less sometimes is MORE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Thomas,

Yea I knew blogging would take up a decent chunk of time, I guess I didn&#039;t realize how much &quot;free time&quot; I had until I started blogging and now it feels like there is none.  But the problem for me is I need to keep on a schedule, such as my Tuesday and Thursday postings.  If I didn&#039;t have that schedule and tell myself &quot;Kipp, you gotta stay up and finish a post tonight&quot; I might not do it.  It is good motivation and you can really learn alot in this community and even from some of the responses to your posts.  Maybe not as much when you are bigger and start getting trolled, but I pretty much just have bloggers posting (besides those spam ones of course).
Heh, I think my retired neighbors across the street have the same problem as your grandparents.  I constantly see their cars coming in and out when I am home!  Although when I was talking to them the other day, they basically eat every meal out except MOST breakfasts are at home... crazy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook was always just a filler for me between stuff in college, I am truly not interested in it.  Even for this blog, I have no motivation to go on there and update my latest stuff.  Oddly, I am not having that problem on twitter.  *Shrug*.

Yea Youtube can be a time killer... don&#039;t remind me of those HISHE videos, or Honest Trailers, or Epic Meal Time&#039;s, or Epic Rap Battles, etc!  But hey, it is cheap entertainment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t find alot of difficulty on the material side yet, I do find difficulty in having enough time to materialize all my thoughts and trying to do at least a little research on topics.

As you may have noticed... I haven&#039;t been visiting other blogs AS MUCH lately, still trying to hit up everyone on my blogroll at least weekly though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t waste a whole lot of time, so that&#039;s great!  The way I get the most out of my time is by scheduling everything.  I seriously mean everything.  I schedule writing, lifting weights, running, reading, family time, date nights with my wife, story time with my kids, household chores...everything.

I have found that if I put it on my schedule, it gets done.  If I don&#039;t, I will forget about it or do something less productive.  I use Google calendar, so it links to my wife&#039;s phone.  We always have our entire week planned out, so we always know what to expect.  Occasionally, something comes up, but most time, we stay on track.

I enjoyed reading this article.  I love seeing where other people spend their time and learning from you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting to see how you spend your time, Kipp! We have quite a similar pattern, but that shouldn&#039;t be too surprising given that we&#039;re both working full-time and both have to sleep.

I used to have more than enough time to do everything I wanted - even with a full-time job - but ever since I started blogging I feel there aren&#039;t enough hours in a day anymore. I wish I could spend more time working on my blog because I have so many ideas, but that&#039;s the way of things, I guess.

Also, fun fact: my retired grandparents also constantly complain they don&#039;t have enough time... &quot;Too many dinners and parties to go to!&quot; :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think everyone has the same problem - a lot to do in not a lot of time. I think whatever your personal situation may be its best to keep time wasting things to a minimum if possible - I find you tube is the worst for this as well as social media]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think blogging is taking up too much of my time nowadays.  So I&#039;m aiming to only write one post per week.  It&#039;s difficult to constantly come up new materials in such a short period.

It sure looks like you have a lot on your plate.  Good luck!]]></description>
