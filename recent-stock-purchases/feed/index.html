		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Henry!  These are on automatic as I mentioned, a great way to know that interest will be flowing into my credit union hassle free!  Being they are on automatic, I was more concerned about the quality of the company than the price, so I may not be entering in at the best value right now, but I want companies that will produce great results long term.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks R2R!  I am happy breaking the $300 mark for sure!  It will more than likely take a jump next update since I know for certain the ROTH is in motion, if we get an average of 3% on a yield from those funds we should be looking at over $500 a month in forward dividends.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If P&amp;G was included on Loyal3 I would have grabbed them instantly over UL.  I will have to take a decent look into them once that ROTH transfer completes, but right now the values in investing seem to be in financials and telecoms.  That can change of course if this pullback continues, it might end up being great timing for this to happen!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea, I probably shouldn&#039;t have pulled the trigger in acquiring RGR since they had already cut their dividend.  It wasn&#039;t wise in hindsight.  That said, I think they will fare better in the future, they aren&#039;t going away and will provide a better opportunity to sell at some point.  But clearly the current management wasn&#039;t too concerned about being a future dividend contender as they were until the dividend cuts.]]></description>

There are no commission / transaction fees with Loyal3, which is why I CAN invest $10 at a time.  However, they do have a limited selection of stocks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All solid companies. I keep looking at Proctor and Gamble wanting it to drop a bit so I can jump in but it doesn&#039;t seem to go down. Its just my luck, any time Im ready to buy a stock it never seems to drop. Maybe I should just bite the bullet and buy now]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These are all fantastic choices; I doubt you&#039;ll regret any of these in a decade. I&#039;m personally long KO and MCD myself, but hope to be long the rest eventually. DIS&#039;s dividend history especially gave me pause, but of course, with my characteristic hesitation, it got away from me. With any hope it&#039;ll get back into my range. Also, I love RGR. It&#039;s a great stock, but unfortunately it met my sell criteria a while ago, so I had to sell it. I hope to own it again for sure, since it&#039;s a fantastic company in general. All the best!]]></description>
