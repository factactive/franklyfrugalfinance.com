		<description><![CDATA[Although I haven&#039;t had the pleasure of truly experiencing international travel, I have heard many people that have respond with similar sentiments.  My wife and I talk about possibly doing some international travel once we are financially independent and the kids are their feet (have to have those kids first as well).  But who knows, plans can change, but I think being FI will give us a chance to actually experience another country rather than blaze through in a week looking at all the tourist traps.  If we are going to pay to fly over there, we should get our money&#039;s worth out of that plane ticket and spend time appreciating the culture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FFF,

You are spot on about winning life&#039;s lottery.  I&#039;ve worked in a 3rd-world country and consider myself lucky to be born in the U.S.  So many aspects of life that are taken for granted (cars, houses, electricity, heat, a/c, water, food, etc) are only dreams for those in 3rd-world countries.

Regards,
Dear Dividend]]></description>

Kipp puts it all into perspective for us, explaining just how lucky we all are to have been born in places that allow us to even think about pursing financial independence dreams.

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Kipp. I think I&#039;ll agree with Zee in that my parents were my &quot;lottery ticket.&quot; Without them instilling the discipline and work ethic that I&#039;ve carried over to my adult life, I don&#039;t think I would be as into finance/investing and working towards a goal of financial independence as I am today.
 
It&#039;s real easy sometimes, especially when it comes to finance, to get caught up with the small things and not appreciate just how good we have it here to begin with. Me worrying about what stock I&#039;m going to buy next for my portfolio sounds kind of silly when comparing to how a lot of people in this world are just worrying about their basic needs (food, shelter, etc.). Thanks for putting it in perspective and reminding us.

Best wishes,
SFZ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea, I think it is good to remember that how bad things may seem sometimes, that it could be worse.  A lot worse.  I was just looking at your blog and your recent buys you appear to have partial shares purchased.  How does that work?  Thanks for stopping by!

		<description><![CDATA[Great article to remind us about our &quot;first world problems&quot; that many of us have and realize that a lot of people in the world have it a lot worse than we do. It&#039;s stories like these that are great reminders to not sweat the small stuff and be thankful for the things we take for granted such as good health, shelter, clothing and other basic needs. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My parents helped with college for sure.  During community college I stayed at home and they payed the tuition while I paid for books.  Then for the my Bachelors they inversed and paid for books while I paid for tuition.  I did commute from home one semester for this and I just got worn out and got an apartment.  I graduated with the ability to pay off my only student loans with the cash I had in the bank, but I married into more student loans :).  Since I was attacking those loans aggressively, when my car broke I didn&#039;t have the cash to find a suitable replacement.  I didn&#039;t focus on the need for an emergency fund enough at that time, I was overly concerned with debt and just created more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heh, yeah I&#039;m doing much better than a lot of people. I was born into a family where I was taught valuable lessons and learned to be fairly sensible with my money. I have written before that I&#039;ve never really dealt with debt, my parents were generous enough to put me through college so that when I finally got started in life I started from zero instead of in a hole. My parents are my lottery ticket, without them I would be nowhere near where I am today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea, I find that I am much better with a debit or credit card.  I would look at a single purchase like this and say to myself, even before I was tracking expenses, &quot;Doesn&#039;t it look stupid to have to buy a $2 item on a credit/debit card?&quot;.  Now that I am tracking expenses, it is even worse because then I have to record my error.  Now with blogging I have a third layer, where I publicly display my good and bad choices.

Maybe if I keep making bad spending choices I should keep publicly shaming myself?  That will really put the thought in my mind - &quot;Don&#039;t buy that unless if it is REALLY useful, you don&#039;t want to blog about that, now do you?&quot;]]></description>
