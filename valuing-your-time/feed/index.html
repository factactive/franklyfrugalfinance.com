		<description><![CDATA[Thanks HHWG,
I&#039;m glad to hear that you are finding life balance!  From the sounds of it kids grow up very fast, I probably won&#039;t be financially independent myself until they are about to head off to college, but I hope at some point I will be free enough to reduce my schedule at the very least.  Right now not too much of an option, too much debt and not enough savings.  However, time is on my side (at least I hope it is!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wow this a great post! I am learning to say no to jobs proposals more often now days even if it means to earn less for now. My oldest child is going to college next year and I still can&#039;t believe that time passed by so quickly! With every day passing by I just want to stop in each and every moment and enjoy it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Henry.  Once you look at income or money saving activities through a dollar per hour basis, I think you can make the best decisions on what to do with your time.  You still have to do the activities to see how much they may or may not save you, but then you can decide which ones are worth the time and which are not.  I am finding that traveling other places for groceries is probably not worth my time, but making laundry soap paid be a better rate than my regular job.  The thing about money saving activities is you can fit them around your schedule whereas a second income may not be as flexible.
So I say experiment away which side income and money saving activities and see which ones are worth continuing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post!  I&#039;ve been pondering about the balance between making memories or money now.  Life is meant to be enjoyed.  But then again, life involves responsibility too, both personally and financially.  It&#039;s something I&#039;m pondering about lately.

Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi No Nonsense Landlord,

That is a very good point because compounding will do the heavy lifting later.  You just need to get the ball rolling somehow, and it looks like your method is paying off your rentals!  I still have alot of other debt to deleverage as well as investing to be made.  Rentals sound interesting, but I think I may go the REIT route at some point unless if my maintenance skills get drastically better in the next decade.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Time is very valuable, you only have so much.  As I prepare for early retirement, it&#039;s even more apparent.

When you have the opportunity to swap time for money, you have to ask yourself if you want to work now, or later.  Working now for one hour might give you two or more hours of leisure later on.]]></description>
